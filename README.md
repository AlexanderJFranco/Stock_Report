This repository contains code for a Flask application that dumps json data sets.
The end goal for this project is to be hosted by an AWS EC2 instance and function as a 
Restful API that returns the resulting Json via Http requests.

The React web app that is powered by this hosted API is currently in development.
Further documentation on this project will be included within the repository storing the React project.
